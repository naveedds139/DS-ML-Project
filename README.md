Consider there is a submarine,there is a war going on between two countries.Submarine of one country is going underwater to another country and enemy country is planted some mines(it explodes when some subject comes into contact with it) in the ocean.there will be also rocks in the ocean.The submarine wants to predict whether it is crossing rocks or mine. Our project is to make a system that can predict wether the object beneath the submarine is a mine or a rock.How this is done is submarine uses a sonar that sends a sound signal,the signal is then processed to detect whether the object is mine or rock.
